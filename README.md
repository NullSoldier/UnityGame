Overral
 * Many small dungeonss with cooperative challenges found

Cooperative Ideas
  * All players control a boat and have to button mash to paddle while 1 person controls rudder
  * All players are in a cannon shooting between cannons that are moving
  * Timed puzzle swap
  * In an air balloon darts shooting at the balloon part

Monster Ideas
  * Monster that exists underground except for a hand that sticks up trying to grab a player. If a player is caught other players have to find the bump in the ground and press a button to make them release the player. In single player, that player can button mash to be forced to let go. Statues of that hand sticking out of the ground would be found around the level

World Ideas
 * Alpine world (pines, granite mountains, grass, snow, wind, furry bigfoot esque monsters)
 * Aztec world (Vertical terrain, feathers, stone temples, stone, traps, skeleton monsters)
